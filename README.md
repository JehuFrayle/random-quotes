# Random quotes generator
Honestly, I don't remember why I'm doing this, but here we are.

## APIs
For this project I'm using two different APIs:

- [Quote API](https://rapidapi.com/martin.svoboda/api/quotes15) by Martin Svoboda. If you want to replicate the project you will need an API key, you can get it easily in Rapid API.
- [Fake face API](https://github.com/hankhank10/fakeface) by hankhank10.

## Building with React
I think this is the first time a build and deploy a React App, so I try to make it easy by using Create React App. I had some troubles with CRA, but overall it went well.

I learned about using **React Context** for share information through components.
